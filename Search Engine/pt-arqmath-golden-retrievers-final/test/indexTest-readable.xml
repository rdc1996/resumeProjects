Basically, you suppose that <span class="math-container" id="63">\sqrt{2}</span> can be written as <span class="math-container" id="64">p/q</span>. Then you know that <span class="math-container" id="65">2q^2 = p^2</span>. However, both <span class="math-container" id="66">q^2</span> and <span class="math-container" id="67">p^2</span> have an even number of factors of two, so <span class="math-container" id="68">2q^2</span> has an odd number of factors of 2, which means it can't be equal to <span class="math-container" id="69">p^2</span>.</p> " ParentId="5"/>

So far I've only figured out creating an array and counting to the value, which is incredibly simple, but I reckon I can't find any formula for calculating a Fibonacci number based on it's position.</p>  <p>Is there a way to do this? If so, how are we able to apply these formulas to arrays?</p> " AnswerCount="7" AcceptedAnswerId="17" Tags="<linear-algebra><combinatorics><generating-functions><fibonacci-numbers>"/>
